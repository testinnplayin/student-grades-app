This app is to solve a pain point many teachers face: how to deal with all of their students grades in several classes? Teachers can end up teaching multiple classes every term, every year and these classes can have a lot of students in them. Recording grades in some sort of database/spreadsheet takes a long time. Once this app is completed it will do several things:
##1. Allow teachers to enter students in their classes into a Mongo database and to record every grade for every assignment the students are graded on.
##2. Look at trends in their students and in their classes from year-to-year.

This current iteration of the app is an incomplete MVP to get started on entering classes and students into the Mongo Database via Node on the back-end and jQuery on the front-end. It is by no means a polished app.

#Current Features:
##1. Can create/edit/delete and view a class.
##2. Can create students.
##3. Can obtain pre-seeded grades in the database for each student and calculate their GPA and their median grade.

#Future Features:
##1. Can edit/delete students.
##2. Can view a student and see his grades and statistics.
##3. Will be able to sort grades, sort students and classes and finally sort through assignments/exams and grades.
##4. Will have a chart API that shows trends for students from year-to-year but also class grades.
##5. Provide accounts for the teachers with encryption of passwords. These accounts will be able to draw up the history of the teacher's classes.
##6. Will be able to bulk load students/grades for assignments.
##7. Technology will hopefully be updated soon to be a React application rather than hand-coded jQuery.

#Technology Used: Node/Express (and many modules such as Chai and Mocha), MongoDB/Mongoose, jQuery, SASS
